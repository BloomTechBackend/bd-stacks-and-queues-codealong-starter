# Exploring `Stacks and Queues` Code Along

This activity will be walked through by your instructor.

**Your participation is critical to your understanding**, so please respond when asked by the instructor and ask any questions you may have immediately.

Please do not be afraid to ask questions.  Chances are very good that others have the same and/or similar questions and are bashful about asking.  They will appreciate your asking the question.

### Part 1 - Bracket Checker

In this project you will create a bracket validity checker to identify if each {} and ()s have corresponding start and end symbols. This could be used as part of a lint checker to determine the validity of Java source code.

### Optional Part 2 - Rolling Mean Calculator

In this project you will implement the logic to calculate rolling means. Rolling means are used to show trends in data (stock markets, prices, health outbreaks, etc.) over intervals of time.

### Optional Part 3 - Palindrome Checker

Want to test your own capability with stacks and queues?

Implement the logic for a Palindrome checker by restricting yourself to using Stacks and Queues instead of random access capabilities.

Note: *This can be solved without using Stacks and Queues. The intention is to try out your new knowledge as an alternative approach.*
